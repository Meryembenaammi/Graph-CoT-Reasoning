# Graph-CoT: Structured Reasoning over Graphs

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of **Graph Chain-of-Thought (Graph-CoT)**,
a structured reasoning approach for Large Language Models on graph-based problems.

## Tasks
- Cycle Detection (lc210)
- Path Finding (lc797)
- Reachability

## Methodology
- Graph encoding
- Structured Chain-of-Thought
- Comparative evaluation with standard prompting

## Results
Graph-CoT improves accuracy from **65.3%** to **83.5%** on GraphEval36K benchmarks.

## Demo
An interactive Streamlit dashboard is provided to visualize results and reasoning behavior.
